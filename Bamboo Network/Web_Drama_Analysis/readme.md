I analyzed two mega-hit Korean web-drama, "Eighteen" and "When you're on the blacklist of bullies."
I did this analysis with the goal of "Finding factors affecting Youtube views."
To do so, I considered what is the best data for finding the factors.
My conclusion was that I could catch the point where viewers focus on by analyzing Youtube comments which include Time Stamp.

All the python files in this folder are related to the analysis I mentioned above.
I would like to show the outcome of my analysis, but it is confidential.
